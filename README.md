# Totally Tabular

This is the repo of our CSE2102 project, TotallyTabular, based on Impro-Visor by Robert M. Keller. https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/jazz/improvisor/

We implemented guitar tabs in the improvisor software.

To demo, place notes (or hit Improv), then click the guitar icon on the toolbar. The window will show the generated tablature (standard 6-string tuning). Resize the window to re-render the tablature to a better-fitting width.
