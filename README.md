# Totally Tabular

https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/jazz/improvisor/

This is the repo of our CSE2102 project, TotallyTabular, based on Impro-Visor by Robert M. Keller.

We are planning to implement guitar tabs in the improvisor software.

## Todo

* Tabbed note placement based on previously placed notes (important)
* Bar lines
* Rests? Or rather, just more dashes to indicate significant pauses
* Multiple staves for one tab (important)
* Capture dialog window resize event and regenerate tabs
* Input boxes for guitar tuning, custom number of strings, custom number of frets
* Prettier dialog box, gridding, etc
* Menu bar icon
