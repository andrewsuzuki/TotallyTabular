Building Impro-Visor Version 5.xx from source:

You will need to have installed already:

    Java Virtual Machine (jvm) version 1.6 or later

    Apache ant

Connect to the root directory of the release.

Execute:

    ant improvisor

That will both build the sources if necessary and run the application.


If you would like a stand-alone application, execute

    ant zip

That will create a .zip file with containing the java jar "executable"
and the necessary support files.
